# Claude Context
## Making Claude Contextually Intelligent

---

### The Problem

Claude is exceptional at reasoning. But every interaction starts from zero.

Professionals spend 15+ minutes per session re-explaining their organization, projects, decisions, and constraints. The context that makes Claude genuinely useful is scattered across Notion, Confluence, Slack, GitHub, and Figma—none of which Claude can persistently access.

**Result:** Claude remains a brilliant stranger, not a knowledgeable colleague.

---

### The Opportunity

**Claude Context** is the infrastructure layer that makes Claude contextually intelligent across sessions, tools, and teams.

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Context Graphs** | Living knowledge bases Claude can consume |
| **Work Slices** | AI-ready work units with rich, structured context |
| **Feedback Loops** | Systems that learn from Claude's effectiveness |
| **Cross-Product Integration** | Shared intelligence across Chat, Code, and Cowork |

### Why Anthropic Must Build This

| Strategic Imperative | Risk if We Don't |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Capture enterprise value** | Claude becomes a commodity API |
| **Create switching costs** | Competitors build the context layer |
| **Improve Claude itself** | Miss real-world training signal |
| **Enable ecosystem** | MCP servers lack persistent foundation |

Microsoft, Notion, Linear, and Salesforce are racing to add AI with *their* context. If Anthropic doesn't own the context layer, someone else will—and Claude becomes their backend.

### Product Vision

**In Claude Chat:** Context panel shows what Claude sees. Citations trace reasoning to sources.

**In Claude Code:** `claude context status` shows active knowledge. Auto-detection from git repos.

**In Cowork:** Visual context graph. Slice management as primary workflow.

### Why Me

I've spent the last year building exactly this:

- **GWI Engineering Transformation Platform** – Repository scanning for AI-readiness
- **NEXUS Platform** – AI-native development infrastructure  
- **The Forge Method** – Enterprise AI adoption methodology

I don't theorize about context being the bottleneck—I've measured it, built solutions, and seen results.
